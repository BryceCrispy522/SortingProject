**Overview**

This project implements and compares the performance of various sorting algorithms in C++. Each algorithm is evaluated based on execution time, the number of comparisons, and swaps performed during sorting.

Implemented Sorting Algorithms
Selection Sort, 
Exchange Sort, 
Bubble Sort, 
Insertion Sort, 
Merge Sort, 
Quick Sort, 
Heap Sort

**Features**

- Measures execution time for each sorting algorithm.
- Tracks the number of comparisons and swaps.
- Verifies the correctness of sorting results.
- Uses high-resolution timers for accurate performance measurement.

**How It Works**
The program initializes an array with random values and sorts it using different algorithms while recording performance metrics. Results are displayed in the console, showing execution time, comparisons, swaps, and whether the sorting was successful.
